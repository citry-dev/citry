# Benchmarks

Rendering-performance comparison between citry, django-components (DJC),
vanilla Django templates, and Jinja2. The design, scope, and roadmap live in
[`docs/design/benchmarking.md`](../docs/design/benchmarking.md); this README
covers running the comparison and reading its output.

Citry's graph-first browser workload has a separate runner because browser
startup, fragment adoption, morph, heap, and client payloads are not comparable
to server render time. Run it with:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python benchmarks/client.py \
  --browser chromium --counts 10 100 325 --rounds 9 --memory
```

It discards one cold round, reports median and p95, and rejects samples with
browser errors, incomplete runtime resources, or wrong initializer and
cleanup counts. `--json` emits the complete measurement record, including a
Git description whose `-dirty` suffix preserves uncommitted-run provenance.
Deterministic payload limits are enforced by
`packages/py/citry/tests/test_client_performance_payload.py`; browser timings
are informational. The exact workload, interpretation rules, and budgets are
recorded in
[`docs/design/alpinejs/a10_performance.md`](../docs/design/alpinejs/a10_performance.md).

The final i18n server gate has its own short bounded runner:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python benchmarks/i18n.py --json
```

It compares an equivalent literal tree with 100 warm message resolutions and
20 named ICU4X format calls. It also compiles 10,000 messages in each of three
locales and checks compile time, raw and compressed artifact size, and peak
memory. Five warmups and 30 render samples enforce the release limits in
`docs/design/i18n.md` section 14.3. Build `citry-core` in release mode first; a
debug native extension invalidates the timing result.

## How it works

The benchmarked code lives in `packages/py/citry/tests/` as self-contained
`test_benchmark_*.py` scenario files (one per engine and size), each exposing
`gen_render_data()` and `render(data)` entrypoints and verified by the normal
pytest suite. The runner never imports them: it reads each file as a source
string, slices out the pytest section at the file's markers (the upstream
django-components convention from
[PR #999](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/999)),
and times the result in a fresh subprocess per round so no state leaks
between cells.

Engines:

| Row | What it is |
|---|---|
| `django` | Vanilla Django templates (vendored DJC scenario; it still imports django-components for `{% html_attrs %}`, so read it as "the relative cost of components", not pure Django) |
| `django-components` | The DJC component scenario, vendored byte-close to upstream |
| `citry` | The citry port of the same UI, plain inputs |
| `citry-const` | The same port with each component's render-invariant literals marked `Const` (the opt-in render-caching optimization, see `docs/design/component_constness.md`); large scenario only |
| `jinja2` | The same UI in Jinja2, the first engine beyond the Django family. Jinja2 has no component model, so each citry component becomes a macro; provide/inject is threaded as macro arguments, and each component's inline JS is collected by a per-render registry and injected at the `<c-js>` marker. Its `html_attrs` global stands in for Django's `{% html_attrs %}` tag. Both scenarios |

Test types, mirroring upstream so the methodology stays comparable:

| Column | What is timed |
|---|---|
| `startup` | Running the whole scenario script: imports, class and template definitions, no render |
| `import` | Running only the scenario's import section |
| `first` | One render, template parse/compile included |
| `subsequent` | One render, after a warmup render in the same process |

## Running

From the repository root:

```bash
# 1. Install the baseline engines (not part of the default dev install)
uv pip install django==6.0.6 django-components==0.151.0 jinja2==3.1.6

# 2. REQUIRED: build the Rust extension in release mode. The default debug
#    build makes citry's Rust-backed paths many times slower and invalidates
#    every citry number. The runner cannot detect which build is installed.
cd packages/py/citry_core && ../../../.venv/bin/maturin develop --release && cd ../../..

# 3. Run the comparison
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/compare.py            # full: 5 rounds per cell
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/compare.py --quick    # smoke: 2 rounds, no import column
```

One more trap: the very first run after rebuilding the extension loads the
fresh `.so` cold (disk cache, macOS code signing), which can inflate the first
engine's numbers severalfold. Run once, discard, run again.

## Reading the results

The results are RELATIVE values, never absolute (the same rule as upstream
django-components):

- "citry renders this scenario N times faster than DJC on this machine" is a
  valid reading.
- "a render takes X microseconds, so my page will take X" is not: a real page
  has a different mix of templates, components, and data.
- Never compare numbers across machines, runs, or build profiles.

## Results (small scenario)

Measured 2026-06-26 on an Apple M4, Python 3.13.12, median of 5 fresh-process
rounds per cell. Versions: django 6.0.6, django-components 0.151.0, jinja2
3.1.6, citry 0.1.0 (citry_core 1.3.0, release build). Ratios are vs the
`django` row.

| engine | startup | import | first | subsequent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| django | 77.26 ms (1.00x) | 76.66 ms (1.00x) | 1.07 ms (1.00x) | 40.2 us (1.00x) |
| django-components | 77.42 ms (1.00x) | 76.78 ms (1.00x) | 1.41 ms (1.31x) | 202.8 us (5.04x) |
| citry | 29.84 ms (0.39x) | 29.40 ms (0.38x) | 1.63 ms (1.52x) | 73.1 us (1.82x) |
| jinja2 | 14.63 ms (0.19x) | 14.37 ms (0.19x) | 1.20 ms (1.12x) | 23.5 us (0.58x) |

Highlights, with the relative-only caveat above:

- The two bare template engines (django, jinja2) do no per-render component
  work, so they lead the component engines (django-components, citry) on
  render time; the meaningful reading is within each pair.
- jinja2 is the fast no-component baseline it is known for: it imports and
  starts up about 5x faster than the Django stack, and its repeat render is
  about 1.7x faster than a bare Django template (and ~8.6x faster than
  django-components). It pays for that on first render (1.12x), where
  compiling the template to Python bytecode costs a little more than Django's
  parse; the speed shows up on every render after.
- citry imports and starts up about 2.6x faster than the Django stack.
- On repeat renders citry is about 2.8x faster than django-components, the
  fair component-to-component comparison. It trails the two bare template
  engines, which skip the component lifecycle citry runs each render
  (component construction, slot resolution, id marking).
- There is no `citry-const` row here. The single Button computes every value
  it renders from its inputs (the classes, the attributes), so nothing it
  returns is a render-invariant literal to mark constant. Const has a fair
  test in the large scenario, where there are static literals to mark.

The small scenario also has older dated tables in the results log
([`docs/design/benchmarking.md`](../docs/design/benchmarking.md) section 11),
measured on earlier code; compare rows within this run, never numbers across the
dated tables.

## Results (large scenario)

Measured 2026-06-26 on an Apple M4, Python 3.13.12, median of 5 fresh-process
rounds per cell. Versions: django 6.0.6, django-components 0.151.0, jinja2
3.1.6, citry 0.1.0 (citry_core 1.3.0, release build). Ratios are vs the
`django` row. The large scenario is the full project-management page: 35
components, ~325 component instances rendered, JS dependency collection,
provide/inject, slots/fills, and dynamic elements.

| engine | startup | import | first | subsequent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| django | 82.31 ms (1.00x) | 76.87 ms (1.00x) | 17.72 ms (1.00x) | 10.95 ms (1.00x) |
| django-components | 82.08 ms (1.00x) | 77.33 ms (1.01x) | 65.08 ms (3.67x) | 45.92 ms (4.19x) |
| citry | 37.72 ms (0.46x) | 28.63 ms (0.37x) | 37.65 ms (2.12x) | 14.17 ms (1.29x) |
| citry-const | 37.95 ms (0.46x) | 29.17 ms (0.38x) | 40.14 ms (2.26x) | 14.52 ms (1.33x) |
| jinja2 | 18.38 ms (0.22x) | 14.79 ms (0.19x) | 58.14 ms (3.28x) | 6.27 ms (0.57x) |

Highlights, with the relative-only caveat above:

- citry imports about 2.7x and starts up about 2.2x faster than the Django stack.
- Against django-components (the fair comparison, since both pay the
  component-machinery cost) citry is about 1.7x faster on first render and
  about 3.2x faster on repeat renders.
- Both component engines are slower than a bare Django template, which does
  none of the per-render component work (construction, slots, dependency
  collection, id marking); the relevant question is the relative cost of
  using components, and there citry wins. After a round of render-path
  optimization (see the section 11 log in `docs/design/benchmarking.md`),
  citry's repeat render is about 1.3x a bare Django template, down from 1.85x.
- jinja2 (no component model: each component is a macro) is the fastest engine
  to start up and import (about 4.5x to 5x the Django stack, about 2x citry) and has
  the fastest repeat render of any engine here (0.57x a bare Django template,
  about 7.3x faster than django-components), because each render just runs
  pre-compiled macro bytecode. It pays for that on first render (3.28x), where
  the whole macro library compiles at once. The classic compiled-template
  trade-off, at page scale: slowest to warm up, fastest once warm.
- `citry-const` is within noise of plain citry here. The const variant
  (`test_benchmark_citry_const.py`) marks each component's genuinely
  render-invariant values constant (literal attribute dicts, the theme, icon
  paths) and nothing else, which is the correct way to use Const. It folds
  almost nothing extra on this page because a real project page is mostly
  loops over per-render data, and a value marked constant stops being
  constant the moment it is iterated over or indexed into. Const pays off on
  templates with large blocks that are the same every render; a data-driven
  page is the opposite, so the honest result here is "no speedup."

A note on getting here: the first large-scenario run had citry ~37x slower
than Django, which turned out to be a real O(n*depth) bug in citry's
dependency emission (a component's record was re-counted once per ancestor as
nested renders merged, so a 325-instance page resolved ~154,000 records).
Collapsing duplicate records before resolution fixed it (~32x faster repeat
renders) and is what the numbers above reflect. This is the large benchmark
doing its job: surfacing a real scaling bug that the small scenario could not.

`plot.py` renders the chart shown in the project README from the large-scenario
numbers above. After re-measuring that table, update the data in `plot.py` to
match and re-run it: `uv run --no-project --with matplotlib python benchmarks/plot.py`.

Still ahead: asv adoption (per-commit tracking, dashboards, memory
benchmarks), and more engines beyond the Django family (MiniJinja, JinjaX,
django-cotton, ...); see the design doc's section 8. Jinja2 is the first
beyond-Django-family engine, ported for both scenarios
(`test_benchmark_jinja2_small.py` and `test_benchmark_jinja2.py`).
