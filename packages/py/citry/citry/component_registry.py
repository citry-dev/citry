"""
Component registry - maps component names to component classes.

Each ``Citry`` instance owns a ``ComponentRegistry``. Components are
registered automatically at class definition time (via the metaclass),
or manually via ``citry.registry.register()``.

Name normalization follows Vue's convention: a PascalCase class name
is registered under both the lowercased form (``mycard``) and the
kebab-case form (``my-card``). Lookups are case-insensitive, matching
how the Rust compiler lowercases tag names.

Example::

    from citry import Citry, Component

    c = Citry()

    class MyCard(Component):
        citry = c

    # Both forms work
    assert c.registry.get("mycard") is MyCard
    assert c.registry.get("my-card") is MyCard
    assert c.registry.get("MyCard") is MyCard
