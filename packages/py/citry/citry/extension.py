"""
The extension (plugin) system.

Extensions let third-party code (and citry's own subsystems, such as the
built-in JS/CSS dependency handling) hook into the component lifecycle without
touching the core. An extension is a subclass of :class:`Extension` that
implements one or more ``on_*`` hook methods and, optionally, exposes a
per-component nested config class (the ``Component.View`` / ``Component.Cache``
mechanism), HTTP routes (``Extension.urls``), and CLI commands.

Extensions are scoped to a :class:`~citry.citry.Citry` instance (per DJC #1413,
all engine state lives on the ``Citry`` instance). Pass them at construction::

    from citry import Citry, Component, Extension

    class TimingExtension(Extension):
        name = "timing"

        def on_component_rendered(self, ctx):
            print(f"{type(ctx.component).__name__} rendered")

    app = Citry(extensions=[TimingExtension])

The full design, the hook catalog, and the divergences from django-components
are in ``docs/design/extensions.md``. It wires the lifecycle, registration,
render, template, slot, JS/CSS, merge (``on_render_context_merge``), and
serialize hooks, plus the ``emit`` mechanism for extension-owned custom hooks
(the dependencies extension's ``on_dependencies``). The short-circuit /
caching hooks (a future cache extension) are the main piece still deferred.

        Dispatch hook ``name`` to the extensions that define it, combining the
        hooks' returned values per ``result``:

        - ``"none"``: call every extension, ignore returns; return ``None``.
        - ``"first"``: return the first non-``None`` return (short-circuit).
        - ``"map"``: thread ``ctx.<field>`` - each non-``None`` return replaces it
          (via ``dataclasses.replace``) and is passed to the next extension; the
          final field value is returned.

        An extension defines ``name`` by overriding it (see
        ``_extensions_with_hook``). ``name`` need not be a hook declared on
        :class:`Extension`, so an extension can fire its own custom hook for
        others to implement (docs/design/extensions.md section 9).

        Examples:
            Most named hooks delegate here. ``on_component_data`` notifies every
            extension that defines it (``"none"``)::

                manager.emit("on_component_data", ctx)

            ``on_template_loaded`` threads ``ctx.content`` through the extensions
            (``"map"``) and returns the final string::

                manager.emit("on_template_loaded", ctx, result="map", field="content")

            A custom hook can let an extension short-circuit (``"first"`` returns
            the first non-``None`` value)::

                manager.emit("on_my_event", ctx, result="first")
