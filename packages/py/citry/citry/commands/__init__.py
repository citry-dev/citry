The built-in ``citry`` command-line commands and the tree builder.

:func:`build_cli` assembles the root command tree for a resolved ``Citry``
engine: ``citry ext list`` and ``citry ext run <extension> <command>``. The tree
is built per invocation because the ``ext run`` subcommands depend on which
extensions the engine has installed.
