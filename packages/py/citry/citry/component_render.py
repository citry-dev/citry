"""
Component render pipeline.

This module contains the core rendering logic. When a CitryElement is
rendered (via ``.render()``), it calls ``render_impl`` which:

1. Creates a real Component instance (via ``_create_instance``), which
   normalizes inputs and sets instance state (id, kwargs, slots, parent, root)
2. Calls ``template_data()`` and validates it against ``TemplateData``
3. Builds a ``CitryContext`` (the render-scoped state) and the template body
   (a node list), walks the body into a parts list, and returns a
   ``CitryRender`` wrapping the parts plus the context

``render_impl`` returns a ``CitryRender`` (not a string). Serialization to HTML
happens later, via ``CitryRender.serialize()`` (or ``str()``). See
docs/design/rendering.md for the three-phase model.

The slow step, compiling the template (parse + compile + exec) into a
body-generating function, runs once per **component class** and is cached on
the class, since it is the same for a given template. On top of that sits the
``Const`` optimization: parts of the template that depend only on inputs
marked ``Const()`` ("same value on every render") are computed once and the
result is cached per component class and per set of ``Const`` values, so
repeat renders skip that work. See docs/design/constness.md and
citry/constness.py.

Rendering is deferred and stack-driven (no recursion limit on nesting depth),
collects each component's JS/CSS dependencies, and drives the ``on_render``
hook; see docs/design/deferred_rendering.md and on_render.md. Django's
context snapshotting is deliberately not ported: a component receives only
its own props and slots, never an inherited context.

    """
    Render a component and everything inside it, returning a finished CitryRender.

    Called by ``CitryElement.render()``. It renders the top component with
    ``_render_one``, which leaves each nested ``<c-child>`` as an unrendered
    ``DeferredComponent``. This function then renders those children one at a
    time, working through a list instead of calling itself, so a deeply nested
    page never hits Python's recursion limit (see
    docs/design/deferred_rendering.md).

    A component's after-render hooks run once everything inside that component
    has been rendered (so children run before their parents): first its own
    ``on_render`` generator is resumed with the settled result (it may replace
    the output, any number of times), then extensions' ``on_component_rendered``
    runs, and the child's collected dependencies are copied into its parent.

    When a component's render fails, the error travels up the component tree:
    each enclosing component's ``on_render`` generator, then extensions'
    ``on_component_rendered``, runs with the error and may swallow it by
    producing replacement output. An error nothing handles is raised from
    here, carrying the component path in its message
    (docs/design/on_render.md sections 5-6).

    Args:
        element: The component to render (its class, kwargs, slots, and cached
            template body).
        parent: The parent Component instance when rendering inside another
            component's template. Sets the parent/root links.
        provides: The provide/inject entries the rendered component inherits
            (see docs/design/provide.md). Empty for a plain user call; set
            when an element is rendered from inside another render (an
            embedded ``{{ element }}`` or slot content), so the subtree keeps
            the provides active at its render site.

    Returns:
        A finished ``CitryRender`` with every child rendered (no
        ``DeferredComponent`` parts left). Call ``.serialize()`` (or ``str()``)
        on it to get the HTML.

    #    the template variables wrapped in Const() ("same value on every

    #    branch that matches. The result is cached, so later renders with the

    #    entries. A node injected by an extension may use a variable outside
    #    that set; such a variable simply stays un-optimized and re-evaluates
