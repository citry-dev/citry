"""
CitryTemplate - the loaded template of a component class.

A ``CitryTemplate`` is what the asset loader produces from a component's
``template`` / ``template_file`` declaration: the template string plus where it
came from. It completes the ``Citry``-prefixed struct family
(``CitryElement`` for composition, ``CitryRender`` for render output,
``CitryContext`` for render state): this one belongs to the loading phase.

The struct also carries the template's compiled form (the body-generating
function plus parse-time metadata), filled in lazily by the render pipeline on
the first render. Loaded source and compiled form share one lifecycle, so they
live on one object with one per-class cache and one invalidation
(``Component.reset_template()``). The compile *code* stays in
``component_render.py``; it writes into this struct. See
docs/design/asset_loading.md section 4.

    A component's loaded template: the source string, its origin, and its

    Attributes:
        source: The template string, after ``on_template_loaded`` hooks ran.
        origin: Where the template came from, for error messages and debugging.
            The absolute file path for a file template, or
            ``"<module file>::<ClassName>"`` for an inline one.
        filepath: The resolved template file, or ``None`` when the template
            was inlined on the class.
        generate: Internal. The compiled body-generating function; calling it
            yields a fresh node list. ``None`` until the render pipeline
            compiles the template on first render.
        used_vars: Internal. Every variable name the template uses, including
            in nested tags (the parse-time ``Template.used_variables``). Empty
            until compiled. The ``Const`` optimization keys its cache only on
            these.
