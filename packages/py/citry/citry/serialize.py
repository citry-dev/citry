"""
Turn a rendered ``CitryRender`` tree into final HTML, tagging each component's
root element(s) with a ``data-cid-<id>`` marker.

This is the serialize half of the pipeline: rendering builds the
``CitryRender`` tree, and this turns it into a string. Each component's HTML
gets a marker attribute on its root element(s), so the browser can tell which
component rendered which part of the page. When one component's root element is
itself another component, that element carries both markers, e.g.
``<div data-cid-child="" data-cid-parent="">``.

It works in two passes, and neither pass calls itself, so a deeply nested page
does not run into Python's recursion limit (the same reason the render side uses
a queue):

1. Top-down: for each component, build its own HTML with its child components
   left as ``<template c-render-id="...">`` placeholders, then call
   ``transform_html`` once to add the markers to that component's root
   element(s). ``transform_html`` also reports which child placeholders ended up
   at the root; those children inherit the parent's markers (that is how a
   parent's marker reaches a child that is its root element).
2. Bottom-up: replace each placeholder with the child's finished HTML.

See docs/design/deferred_rendering.md section 6.
