"""
Provide/inject: passing data deep down the component tree.

A component makes data available to everything rendered below it with
``Component.provide(key, **data)`` (or the ``<c-provide>`` built-in
component), and a descendant opts in with ``Component.inject(key)``. The data
never enters the template variables; only components that ask for it see it.
This is the citry form of React's ContextProvider and Vue's
``provide()``/``inject()``.

The data travels on ``CitryContext.provides`` along the render path (the
chain of contexts that rendering passes through), so it reaches components
inside slot content rendered below the provider, not just components written
below it. See docs/design/component_provide.md for the full model.

This module holds the building blocks: the immutable payload
(``make_provided``), the key validation, the inject lookup, and the
``MISSING`` sentinel that lets ``inject(key, None)`` genuinely default to
``None``.
