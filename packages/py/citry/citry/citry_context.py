CitryContext - the render-scoped state threaded through one render.

A CitryContext is created at the start of a component's render and passed down
as the template body is walked. It carries the two distinct kinds of state that
flow through a render, kept separate on purpose (see docs/design/rendering.md):

1. ``variables`` - the per-component template variables (the ``template_data``
   output). These do NOT cross a component boundary: a child component gets
   fresh variables from its own ``template_data``, not the parent's.
2. ``extra`` - a tree-wide scratch space for extensions. Extensions stash
   data here during the render, and it is merged from a child's context into
   the parent's (via the ``on_render_context_merge`` hook) when the child's
   ``CitryRender`` is consumed, so data can bubble up across component
   boundaries. Because ``extra`` is shared by everything in the render,
   **its top-level keys are namespaced by owner**: each extension uses a key
   named after itself (the built-in dependencies extension uses
   ``extra["dependencies"]``), and citry-core concepts that more than one
   party may contribute to live under ``extra["citry"]`` (see
   ``EXTRA_CITRY_KEY`` and ``_add_root_markers`` below).
3. ``provides`` - the provide/inject entries active at this point of the
   render (see docs/design/provide.md). Unlike ``extra``, this data only
   flows DOWN, never back up: a component hands it to its children, and a
   ``<c-slot>`` hands it into the slot content it renders. The mapping is
   treated as read-only: a component that provides builds a new mapping with
   its additions instead of changing this one, so contexts can share it
   freely.

``ComponentNode`` is the boundary: each component render gets its own
CitryContext.

Named ``CitryContext`` to keep it clearly distinct from Django's ``Context``.

    Render-scoped state for a single component render.

    Attributes:
        variables: The per-component template variables (the ``template_data``
            output). Read by nodes when evaluating expressions.
        component: The ``Component`` instance currently rendering. Gives a node
            access to the component tree (its ``citry`` registry for resolving
            child component names, and its ``parent``/``root`` linkage). Per the
            decision in docs/design/rendering.md section 4.1, the current
            component is stored on the context, so each component render gets its
            own ``CitryContext``.
        extra: Tree-wide scratch space for extensions (for example the
            collected JS/CSS dependency records). Top-level keys are
            namespaced by owner; see the module docstring.
        provides: The provide/inject entries (key -> immutable payload)
            active at this point of the render. Read-only by convention;
            ``Component.provide`` builds a new mapping rather than mutating
