"""
The ``Const`` optimization: skip re-computing template parts whose inputs
never change.

``Const(value)`` marks a component input as "this will be the same on every
render". The engine uses that promise to do work once instead of on every
render: the first render computes everything in the template that depends
only on ``Const`` values (an expression like ``{{ cols }}`` becomes plain
text, an ``<c-if>`` whose condition is decided keeps only the matching
branch), and the result is cached. Later renders with the same ``Const``
values reuse the cached result and skip all of that work.

How the pieces in this module fit together:

- ``Const`` is the marker. It is a transparent wrapper (a ``wrapt.ObjectProxy``
  subclass): it behaves exactly like the value inside, so user code and
  template expressions never notice it, while the engine can still ask
  ``is_const(x)``. The marker stays on the value as it travels into child
  components, so each component along the way gets the optimization too.
- ``extract_const_vars`` looks at a component's template variables, picks out
  the ``Const``-marked ones, and builds a **cache key** from their names and
  values (``freeze_const`` turns each value into a stable, dict-key-safe
  form).
- ``ConstBodyCache`` is the cache: one pre-computed template per component
  class, combination of ``Const`` values, and visible variable-name set. It
  keeps a bounded number of entries (least recently used entries are dropped
  first) and lives on a ``Citry`` instance.
- ``precompute_const_parts`` does the **precomputing** (the name this module and
  docs/design/component_constness.md use for this step): it walks the compiled template
  once, replaces everything that depends only on ``Const`` values with its final
  text, and leaves the rest to render normally each time.

Guidance for using ``Const``:

- **It is a promise, not verified.** The engine takes the marker at face
  value. Mutating a value after marking it const produces stale output; that
  is the documented trade.
- **Values written in the template are const automatically.** A static
  attribute (``age="30"``, boolean ``compact=""``) or an expression attribute
  that uses no variables (``c-age="30"``, ``c-items="[1, 2]"``) on a
  component tag cannot change between renders, so the engine marks it without
  any opt-in.
- **Mark values that are stable across many renders** (layout constants,
  fixed labels, configuration). Marking a value that differs on every render
  (``Const(user.id)``) defeats the purpose: each distinct value computes and
  caches its own copy, so nothing is ever reused.
- **Slot content is never const.** A component with slot fills still benefits
  from const kwargs, but the fills themselves re-render normally.
- **Defaults:** to make a default constant, mark it explicitly in the typed
  ``Kwargs``: ``cols: int = Const(3)``. When the kwarg is omitted, the marked
  default is used and optimized; when passed, the live value renders as
  usual.
- **The marker flows through plain containers and dataclasses.** The
  auto-converted ``Kwargs`` dataclass stores values as-is, so reading the
  typed view keeps the marker. A validating model (a Pydantic ``Kwargs``)
  accepts a marked input but produces a new value, stripping the marker; the
  value then safely renders un-optimized. To keep const-ness with a
  validating model, read the marked value from ``raw_kwargs``.
- **Transformations drop the marker.** ``Const("hi")`` passed through
  unchanged stays const; ``kwargs["title"].upper()`` returns a plain value.
  Mark the final value if it is the transformed form that is stable.
- **A few C-level APIs reject the marker.** The marker is a proxy object, and
  some built-ins demand the exact built-in type rather than something that
  behaves like it. ``getattr(obj, name)`` raises ``TypeError`` when ``name``
  is a marked string, and ``json.dumps(value)`` fails on a marked value (or
  one nested in the data it serializes). Pass the real value to such an API,
  e.g. ``str(name)`` for an attribute name, or mark the already-serialized
  result instead of the input. Citry's own ``class``/``style`` handling
  unwraps internally, so marked values in templates are fine; the gap is your
  own ``template_data`` calling these APIs directly.

Example:
    Mark an input constant::

        from citry import Component, Const

        class Card(Component):
            template = "<p>{{ cols }}</p>"

            def template_data(self, kwargs, slots):
                return {"cols": kwargs["cols"]}  # the marker flows through

        Card(cols=Const(3)).render()

    A cache key must work as a dictionary key (hashable) and must behave by

    finds the cached entry), and two values that would render differently
    must produce different keys (so a cached result is never reused for the
    wrong value). The rules, per ``docs/design/component_constness.md`` section 7.2:

    - Plain containers (``list``, ``tuple``, ``dict``, ``set``, ``frozenset``)
      are converted element by element into a hashable equivalent, tagged
      with the container kind so for example a list and a tuple of the same

    - Any other hashable value is kept as-is, paired with its exact type.
      The type matters because values that compare equal can still render
      differently: ``True == 1`` but they render as ``"True"`` and ``"1"``.
    - Anything else (an unhashable non-container) returns ``_UNFREEZABLE``:
      the variable is then treated as if it were never marked, and renders
      normally, rather than risk a wrong or unstable key.

    ``Const`` wrappers are unwrapped at every level, so a marker nested inside
    a container does not leak the wrapper type into the key.

    been through ``precompute_const_parts``, so the parts depending on those inputs are

    different optimized bodies.

    Pre-compute the parts of ``body`` that depend only on ``const_vars``.

    This is the step this module calls **precomputing**: given a compiled template
    (``body``, a list of static strings and node objects) and the variables
    promised to be constant (``const_vars``), do the work that depends only
    on those variables right now, once, and return a new body where that work
    is already done. The result goes into ``ConstBodyCache``, so every later
    render with the same const values reuses it. What gets pre-computed:

    - A ``{{ expr }}`` node whose variables are all const is evaluated once
      and replaced with its escaped text.
    - An HTML element's dynamic attribute region (``ElementAttrsNode``) whose
      variables are all const is rendered once and replaced with its text.
      Pass ``precompute_attrs=False`` to keep these regions live: the caller does
      that when an installed extension implements ``on_attrs_resolved``,
      because baking the region would hide it from the extension. A region
      holding a nested-template attribute value also stays live (it renders
      fresh parts each time).
    - An element ``#c-key`` whose variables are all const is evaluated once.
      This remains safe even when ordinary attribute precomputation is off,
      because framework metadata never enters ``on_attrs_resolved``.
    - A ``<c-if>`` whose branch conditions use only const variables is
      decided once: only the matching branch's content remains (itself
      precomputed), the other branches are dropped.
    - A ``<c-if>`` whose conditions use non-const variables is kept (it must
      be decided on every render), but constant expressions INSIDE its
      branches still precompute.
    - A ``<c-for>`` over a const iterable whose body precomputes entirely to text
      is run once here, and the per-iteration text is baked in (within one
      iteration, the loop variables count as const). Capped at
      ``_MAX_UNROLL_ITERATIONS``.
    - A ``<c-for>`` that cannot be pre-run is kept, but constant expressions
      inside its body still precompute: an expression that does not touch the loop
      variables produces the same text on every iteration. The loop branch
      masks its introduced variables while the ``<c-empty>`` branch keeps the
      surrounding scope.
    - Static strings that end up next to each other are joined.

    Everything else stays in place as a normal node and re-evaluates on every
    render. That matters because the precomputed body is SHARED by every render
    with the same const values, while their other (non-const) variables
    differ, so anything not pre-computed must still work for all of them.

    What is never pre-computed, and why (docs/design/component_constness.md sections
    5, 9, 10):

    - ``ComponentNode`` (a child component tag): every render of a child gets
      a fresh component instance and a fresh render id, and its slot content
      captures the surrounding render's state. Its BODY does precompute, though:
      fill bodies and the implicit default-slot body render against this
      component's variables, so const expressions inside slot content are
      pre-computed even while the tag itself stays.
    - ``SlotNode``: which fill it renders comes from the live component
      instance, which changes per render even when the tag itself uses no
      template variables. It also fires the ``on_slot_rendered`` hook. Its
      fallback body precomputes in place, same as a fill body.
    - ``FillNode``: stays (it is consumed when fills are collected, each
      render), but its body precomputes in place.
    - An expression whose VALUE is a ``Slot``, ``CitryElement``, or
      ``CitryRender``: rendering those produces per-render state (render
      ids, collected dependencies), so only values that become plain text
      may be baked in.
    - Node types this step does not know (an extension may inject custom
      nodes via ``on_template_compiled``): kept as-is, to be safe.

    **Precomputing never raises.** A const expression or condition that fails here
    is kept as a normal node, so the error (if any) surfaces during a render,
    through the normal path, exactly as it would without the optimization.
    The trade-off of precomputing inside kept ``<c-if>`` branches is WHEN a const
    expression runs: it is evaluated once here even if the branch it sits in
    is not taken by this particular render (a later render sharing the cache
    entry may take it). Citry expressions are expected to have no side effects
    (the sandbox enforces it by default), so running one early should not be
    observable.

    One sharp edge of pre-running loops: a one-shot iterable (a generator)
    marked const is consumed by the attempt. If the attempt then has to back
    out (a value deep in the body turns out to be a ``Slot``/element), the
    kept loop node re-iterates the exhausted generator and renders empty.
    A const generator is already broken across renders (the second render
    would find it exhausted either way), so this is the same misuse,
    surfacing one render earlier.

    ``const_vars`` maps the const template variables to their values (still
    wrapped in ``Const``; the wrapper behaves like the value), as produced by
    ``extract_const_vars``. With no const variables the pass still precomputes
    expressions that use no variables at all and joins static strings.

    ``visible_names`` is the complete set of names in the live render context.
    It lets loop precomputing preserve the runtime no-shadowing rule even when
    the colliding outer value is not const. Production callers always pass it;
    direct callers that omit it get the names from ``const_vars``.

    The input list and its nodes are not modified; a kept node whose interior
    changed is rebuilt (nodes hold no per-render state, so sharing the
    unchanged ones is safe).
