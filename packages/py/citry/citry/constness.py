"""
Const marker for the const-folding feature.

``Const(value)`` marks a component input as constant across renders. It is a
transparent proxy (a ``wrapt.ObjectProxy`` subclass): it behaves exactly like
the wrapped value, so end-user code and template expressions can use a Const
value just like the underlying value, while the engine can still detect
const-ness (``isinstance(x, Const)``) as the value flows down the component
tree. The marker is never unwrapped during rendering, so each descendant that
receives a Const value can detect it and key its own body cache on it.

The render pipeline detects const-marked context variables and uses them to key
a body cache (see ``docs/design/constness.md``). Folding (specializing the body
per const signature) is not yet implemented.

Example:
    Mark an input constant::

        from citry import Component, Const

        class Card(Component):
            template = "<p>{{ cols }}</p>"

            def template_data(self, kwargs, slots=None, context=None):
                return {"cols": kwargs["cols"]}  # the marker flows through

        Card(cols=Const(3)).render()
