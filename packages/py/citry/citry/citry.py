"""
The Citry global instance - scopes all component state.

A Citry instance owns a component registry, settings, and transient
rendering state. All Component classes are assigned to a Citry instance
(either explicitly via ``Component.citry = my_citry`` or implicitly to
the default instance).

Example:
    Using the default instance (most common)::

        from citry import Component

        class MyTable(Component):
            template = "<table>...</table>"

    Using a custom instance::

        from citry import Citry, Component

        my_citry = Citry()

        class MyTable(Component):
            citry = my_citry
            template = "<table>...</table>"

    Isolated instances for testing::

        def test_my_component():
            test_citry = Citry()
            # Components registered here don't leak to other tests
            class MyTable(Component):
                citry = test_citry
                template = "..."

    A Citry instance owns:
    - A ``registry`` (``ComponentRegistry``) mapping names to classes

    - Transient rendering state

    All Component classes are assigned to a Citry instance at class

    Benefits over module-level globals:
    - All transient state has a maximum lifetime bound to the Citry

    - Tests can use isolated instances for clean state.
    - Multiple independent component trees can coexist.
