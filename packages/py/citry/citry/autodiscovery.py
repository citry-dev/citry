"""
Find and import a project's component modules.

A component registers itself with its ``Citry`` instance when its class body
runs (the metaclass does it; see ``citry/component.py``). So the only thing
needed to "discover" components is to make sure their ``.py`` files get
imported. Autodiscovery does exactly that: it walks the directories you gave
``Citry(dirs=...)``, turns each ``.py`` file into an import path, and imports
it. Defining the classes is what registers them.

The directories must be importable, i.e. each one (or a parent of it) is on
Python's import path (``sys.path`` / ``PYTHONPATH``). That is how a file path
such as ``/proj/components/card.py`` is turned into the import name
``components.card`` that Python would use for it. Anchoring on the import path
(rather than importing a file by its location) keeps every component's identity
the one Python already knows, which the cache keys and script URLs built from it
rely on. A directory that holds component modules but is not importable raises a
clear error rather than guessing.

Triggered from ``Citry`` (the ``autodiscover`` setting runs it once on first
use, and ``Citry.autodiscover()`` runs it on demand); this module only provides
the mechanics and depends on nothing inside citry.

    module that was already loaded is not re-run; for those, this re-registers
    the components directly (see ``_register_existing_components``). The end

    the module's own component classes and registers any that its ``Citry``
    instance is missing, so a re-scan (for example after ``Citry.clear()``)
    rebuilds the registry exactly as the first scan did. A class that is still
    registered is skipped, so this is safe to run repeatedly.

    Only classes *defined* in this module are considered (a class imported from
