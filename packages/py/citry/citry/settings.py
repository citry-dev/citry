"""
The Citry settings schema.

``CitrySettings`` is the typed, immutable configuration for a ``Citry`` instance.
It starts small and grows field-by-field as the engine does. Unknown settings
are rejected: ``Citry`` accepts only the fields defined here.

See ``docs/design/extensions.md`` section 5.2 for the rationale (a real schema
object, not a loose dict).

    Immutable settings for a ``Citry`` instance.

        extensions: The extension spec (classes, instances, or ``"path.Class"``
            import strings) the instance's ``ExtensionManager`` builds from.
            Stored as an immutable tuple; extensions are fixed at construction.
        extensions_defaults: Per-extension global default config, keyed by
            extension name. Merged between an extension's factory defaults and a
            component's own nested config class (see the extension system's
            three-level config precedence).
        cache: The cache backend spec (a :class:`citry.cache.CitryCache`
            object or a ``"path.to.Cache"`` import string). ``None`` gives the
            instance its own in-memory cache. The live backend built from this
            spec is ``Citry.cache``. See docs/design/dependencies.md
            section 10.
