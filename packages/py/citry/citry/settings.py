"""
The Citry settings schema.

``CitrySettings`` is the typed, immutable configuration for a ``Citry`` instance.
It starts small and grows field-by-field as the engine does. Unknown settings
are rejected: ``Citry`` accepts only the fields defined here.

See ``docs/design/extensions.md`` section 5.2 for the rationale (a real schema
object, not a loose dict).

    Immutable settings for a ``Citry`` instance.

    Attributes:
        extensions: The extension spec (classes, instances, or ``"path.Class"``
            import strings) the instance's ``ExtensionManager`` builds from.
            Stored as an immutable tuple; extensions are fixed at construction.
        extensions_defaults: Per-extension global default config, keyed by
            extension name. Merged between an extension's factory defaults and a
            component's own nested config class (see the extension system's
            three-level config precedence).
        dirs: Directories searched when resolving a component's asset files
            (``template_file``, ``js_file``, ``css_file``, and ``Dependencies``
            entries), after the directory of the component's own ``.py`` file.
            Entries must be absolute paths; ``Citry.__init__`` validates them.
        cache: The cache backend spec (a :class:`citry.cache.CitryCache`
            object or a ``"path.to.Cache"`` import string). ``None`` gives the
            instance its own in-memory cache. The live backend built from this
            spec is ``Citry.cache``.
        sandbox_expressions: Whether template expressions (``{{ ... }}`` and
            dynamic ``c-*`` attributes) are evaluated in the security sandbox.
            On by default. Turning it off evaluates expressions as plain Python,
            which is faster but removes security guardrails.
            Only do so when every template comes from a trusted source.
        autodiscover: Whether to import the component modules under ``dirs`` the
            first time a component is looked up, so their classes register
            themselves without being imported by hand. On by default; a no-op
            when no ``dirs`` are set (so the default instance does nothing). The
            directories must be importable (on ``sys.path``/``PYTHONPATH``). See
            ``Citry.autodiscover`` and ``citry.autodiscovery``.
