"""
CitryRender - the output of rendering a CitryElement.

The rendering pipeline has three phases, each with its own struct (see
docs/design/rendering.md):

    Component(**kwargs)       -> CitryElement   compose: "what to render"
    CitryElement.render()     -> CitryRender    render: parts + collected metadata
    CitryRender.serialize()   -> str (HTML)     serialize: join + place deps

``CitryRender`` is the middle struct, and on purpose it is NOT a string. Keeping
the render output as an object lets an already-rendered piece be reused. You can
pass a ``CitryRender`` to another component (as a kwarg, inside ``{{ ... }}``, or
in an attribute); the component that receives it pulls in its HTML and copies up
its collected data (JS/CSS dependencies). Turning it into a string
(``str()``/``serialize()``) is the final step that produces the HTML. This is the
citry form of django-components #1650 ("cache the render object, not the string").

A ``CitryRender`` holds:

- ``parts``: an ordered list whose items can be different types. Each part is a
  ``str`` (static or already-rendered text) or a nested ``CitryRender`` (a piece
  not yet joined into text). Joining only at the end keeps reuse cheap and keeps
  the dependencies readable until the final serialize.
- ``context``: the ``CitryContext`` used during the render. For now the whole
  context is kept (the collected data lives in its ``extra``); this can be
  narrowed to specific fields once we know what serialize needs.

Serialization joins the parts, stamps the ``data-cid-<id>`` markers, and
places the collected dependencies into the page per the ``deps_strategy`` /
``deps_position`` arguments (docs/design/dependencies.md section 7),
including the ``fragment`` strategy for HTML partials.

Example:
    Render and serialize a component::

        from citry import Component

        class Hello(Component):
            template = "<p>Hello!</p>"

        rendered = Hello().render()      # -> CitryRender
        html = rendered.serialize()      # -> "<p>Hello!</p>"
        assert str(rendered) == html     # str() is a convenience for serialize()

                  static pages and emails; per-instance JS does not run

                  already-loaded page (an HTMX swap, ``fetch`` +
                  ``innerHTML``, ...): nothing is inlined; the output ends

                  fetches, each once per page however many fragments need
                  it. Requires a mounted web integration.
                - ``"ignore"``: no tags inserted.
            deps_position: Where the tags go (``document``/``simple`` only).

                - ``"smart"`` (default): into the ``<c-js>``/``<c-css>``

    limit. Instead the parent records the child as a ``DeferredComponent`` (with
    its inputs already worked out) and carries on. ``render_impl`` later renders

    Convert an evaluated expression value into a body part.

    This is the bridge from an arbitrary Python value (the result of evaluating
    a ``{{ ... }}`` expression, or a value handed into an attribute) to a
    ``RenderPart``. The rules (see docs/design/rendering.md section 3.1 and
    docs/design/slots.md section 3.5):

    - ``None`` renders as the empty string (not the literal ``"None"``).
    - A ``Slot`` is invoked with no data, so ``{{ my_slot }}`` renders slot
      content in place. (Calling it with data, ``{{ my_slot(d) }}``, also lands
      here: the call already produced a render part, handled by the rules
      below.) The slot's fallback handle is a Slot too, so ``{{ fallback }}``
      renders through this same branch.
    - A ``CitryElement`` (a composed-but-unrendered element handed into an
      expression) is rendered now, so its output and dependencies flow into the
      surrounding tree.
    - A ``CitryRender`` (an already-rendered subtree) is inlined as-is; it is
      trusted HTML, and the surrounding ``_render_body`` merges its dependencies.
    - Anything else is autoescaped. ``escape`` respects the ``__html__``
      protocol, so a ``SafeString`` (trusted HTML) passes through unescaped.

    ``provides`` are the provide/inject entries active where the value was
    found; an element rendered here inherits them, so a component embedded
    via ``{{ element }}`` or slot content can ``inject`` what its render site
    provides (docs/design/provide.md section 4.4).

    A ``Const`` marker is unwrapped first: the value is becoming output here,
