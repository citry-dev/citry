CitryRender - the output of rendering a CitryElement.

The rendering pipeline has three phases, each with its own struct (see
docs/design/rendering.md):

    Component(**kwargs)       -> CitryElement   compose: "what to render"
    CitryElement.render()     -> CitryRender    render: parts + collected metadata
    CitryRender.serialize()   -> str (HTML)     serialize: join + place deps

``CitryRender`` is the middle struct, and on purpose it is NOT a string. Keeping
the render output as an object lets an already-rendered piece be reused. You can
pass a ``CitryRender`` to another component (as a kwarg, inside ``{{ ... }}``, or
in an attribute); the component that receives it pulls in its HTML and copies up
its collected data (JS/CSS dependencies). Turning it into a string
(``str()``/``serialize()``) is the final step that produces the HTML. This is the
citry form of django-components #1650 ("cache the render object, not the string").

A ``CitryRender`` holds:

- ``parts``: an ordered list whose items can be different types. Each part is a
  ``str`` (static or already-rendered text) or a nested ``CitryRender`` (a piece
  not yet joined into text). Joining only at the end keeps reuse cheap and keeps
  the dependencies readable until the final serialize.
- ``context``: the ``CitryContext`` used during the render. For now the whole
  context is kept (the collected data lives in its ``extra``); this can be
  narrowed to specific fields once we know what serialize needs.

Serialization is currently just the recursive join of the parts. Placing
collected dependencies into ``<head>``/``<body>`` (document mode) and the
fragment-mode and injection-strategy choices are future work (see
docs/design/rendering.md sections 5-6).

Example:
    Render and serialize a component::

        from citry import Component

        class Hello(Component):
            template = "<p>Hello!</p>"

        rendered = Hello().render()      # -> CitryRender
        html = rendered.serialize()      # -> "<p>Hello!</p>"
        assert str(rendered) == html     # str() is a convenience for serialize()

            the context cannot tell these apart, because slot-fill content

    A child component that has not been rendered yet.

    When the parent's template reaches a ``<c-child>`` tag, citry does not render
    the child right there. Doing so would mean one component renders the next,
    which renders the next, so a deeply nested page would hit Python's recursion
    limit. Instead the parent records the child as a ``DeferredComponent`` (with
    its inputs already worked out) and carries on. ``render_impl`` later renders
    the recorded children one at a time, swapping each ``DeferredComponent`` for
    the child's ``CitryRender``. See docs/design/deferred_rendering.md section 4.

    Attributes:
        element: The child to render: its component class plus the inputs
            (kwargs/slots), already worked out. The inputs are read while the

    Convert an evaluated expression value into a body part.

    This is the bridge from an arbitrary Python value (the result of evaluating

    docs/design/slots.md section 3.5):

    - ``None`` renders as the empty string (not the literal ``"None"``).
    - A ``Slot`` is invoked with no data, so ``{{ my_slot }}`` renders slot
      content in place. (Calling it with data, ``{{ my_slot(d) }}``, also lands
      here: the call already produced a render part, handled by the rules
      below.) The slot's fallback handle is a Slot too, so ``{{ fallback }}``
      renders through this same branch.
    - A ``CitryElement`` (a composed-but-unrendered element handed into an
      expression) is rendered now, so its output and dependencies flow into the
      surrounding tree.
    - A ``CitryRender`` (an already-rendered subtree) is inlined as-is; it is
      trusted HTML, and the surrounding ``_render_body`` merges its dependencies.

      protocol, so a ``SafeString`` (trusted HTML) passes through unescaped.
