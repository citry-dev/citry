"""
CitryRender - the output of rendering a CitryElement.

The rendering pipeline has three phases, each with its own struct (see
docs/design/rendering.md):

    Component(**kwargs)       -> CitryElement   compose: "what to render"
    CitryElement.render()     -> CitryRender    render: parts + collected metadata
    CitryRender.serialize()   -> str (HTML)     serialize: join + place deps

``CitryRender`` is the middle struct. It is deliberately NOT a string: keeping
the render output as an object is what lets a pre-rendered subtree stay
composable. A ``CitryRender`` can be handed to another component (as a kwarg,
inside ``{{ ... }}``, or in an attribute); the consuming tree detects it,
merges its collected metadata (JS/CSS deps) upward, and inlines its HTML. Only
coercing to a string (``str()``/``serialize()``) collapses it to final HTML.
This is the citry form of django-components #1650 ("cache the render object,
not the string").

A ``CitryRender`` holds:

- ``parts``: an ordered, heterogeneous list. Each part is either a ``str``
  (static or already-serialized text) or a nested ``CitryRender`` (an embedded
  subtree not yet joined). Deferring the join keeps embedding cheap and keeps
  the deps recoverable until the final serialize.
- ``context``: the ``CitryContext`` used during the render. For now the whole
  context is kept (the collected metadata lives in its ``extra``); this can be
  narrowed to specific fields once serialization needs are known.

Serialization is currently just the recursive join of the parts. Placing
collected dependencies into ``<head>``/``<body>`` (document mode) and the
fragment-mode and injection-strategy choices are future work (see
docs/design/rendering.md sections 5-6).

Example:
    Render and serialize a component::

        from citry import Component

        class Hello(Component):
            template = "<p>Hello!</p>"

        rendered = Hello().render()      # -> CitryRender
        html = rendered.serialize()      # -> "<p>Hello!</p>"
        assert str(rendered) == html     # str() is a convenience for serialize()

    This is the bridge from an arbitrary Python value (the result of evaluating

    - ``None`` renders as the empty string (not the literal ``"None"``).
    - A ``CitryElement`` (a composed-but-unrendered element handed into an
      expression) is rendered now, so its output and dependencies flow into the
      surrounding tree.
    - A ``CitryRender`` (an already-rendered subtree) is inlined as-is; it is
      trusted HTML, and the surrounding ``_render_body`` merges its dependencies.
    - Anything else is autoescaped. ``escape`` respects the ``__html__``
      protocol, so a ``SafeString`` (trusted HTML) passes through unescaped.
