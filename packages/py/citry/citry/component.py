"""
The Component base class.

A Component is a reusable unit of UI. It owns a template, optionally
defines typed inputs (via inner classes), and produces rendered output
through its lifecycle methods.

Calling a Component class returns a CitryElement (composition phase),
not a rendered string. Rendering happens when ``.render()`` is called
on the CitryElement.

Example:
    Minimal component::

        from citry import Component

        class Greeting(Component):
            template = '<p>Hello {{ name }}!</p>'

            def template_data(self, kwargs, slots):
                return {"name": kwargs.get("name", "World")}

        # Composition - returns a CitryElement
        element = Greeting(name="World")

        # Rendering - produces a CitryRender; serialize() (or str()) -> HTML
        html = element.render().serialize()

    Component with typed inputs::

        from citry import Component

        class Card(Component):
            template = '''
                <div class="card">
                    <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
                    <div>{{ body }}</div>
                </div>
            '''

            class Kwargs:
                title: str
                body: str = ""

            def template_data(self, kwargs, slots):
                return {
                    "title": kwargs.title,
                    "body": kwargs.body,
                }

        # Compose without rendering
        card = Card(title="Hello", body="Content")

        contributes (its ``Dependencies`` entries and its own

        Hook to replace or post-process this component's rendered output.

        Called on every render of this component, after ``template_data`` and
        just before the template renders. Return ``None`` (the default) to
        render the template as usual. Return content to use it as the
        component's whole output instead; the template is then not rendered
        at all. Accepted content:

        - a ``str``, used as-is (NOT autoescaped: it is this component's own
          output, the same trust as its template)
        - a composed element (``OtherComponent(title="hi")``), rendered in
          this component's place
        - an already-rendered ``CitryRender``, inlined
        - a ``Slot``, invoked with no data

        Because ``None`` means "no replacement", return ``""`` to output
        literally nothing.

        Everything the hook needs is on ``self``: ``kwargs``, ``slots``,
        ``parent``, ``inject()``. To pass data to the template, use
        ``template_data``; this hook is for replacing output.

        For example, render a placeholder instead of the template when there
        is no data::

            class MyTable(Component):
                template = "<table>...</table>"

                def on_render(self):
                    if not self.raw_kwargs.get("rows"):
                        return "<p>No data</p>"
                    return None

        **Generator form.** Include a ``yield`` to also see the component's
        finished output, children included, and react to it - for example to
        catch a failing child (this is how error boundaries work)::

            class Guarded(Component):
                template = "..."

                def on_render(self):
                    # BEFORE: runs just before the template renders.
                    result, error = yield

                    # AFTER: result is the completed CitryRender, or None
                    # if rendering failed (then error is the exception).
                    if error is not None:
                        return "<p>Something went wrong</p>"
                    return None

        The protocol:

        - A bare ``yield`` (or ``yield None``) on the first yield means
          "render my template as usual"; yielding content means "use this as
          my output instead" (same accepted values as above).
        - The yield receives ``(result, error)`` once that output has fully
          settled: ``result`` is the live ``CitryRender`` (not a string; do
          not serialize it here unless you are replacing the output with the
          serialized form), or ``None`` when rendering failed, with ``error``
          set. Exactly one of the two is set.
        - You can yield any number of times; each ``yield <content>``
          replaces the output, renders it, and receives the new
          ``(result, error)``. A bare ``yield`` after the first answers
          immediately with the current result unchanged.
        - End with ``return <content>`` to set the final output, ``raise`` to
          make that the component's error, or plain ``return`` to keep the
          current result (an unhandled error keeps bubbling).
